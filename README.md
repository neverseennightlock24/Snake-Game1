# Snake-Game1
A unique take on the classic game of Snake

The first version allows for the Snake to overlap with itself, at the cost of having imprecise Apple spawn locations.

The second version of my program is similar to the contemporary version of the Game that can be found online, where the Snake cannot overlap with itself. Thanks to this, however, the Apple also has precise spawns that line up with the Snake.
